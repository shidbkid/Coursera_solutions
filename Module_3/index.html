			HLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			Biryani
		</div>
		<p>
			Biryani, whilst not unique to Bangladesh, is a spicy rice dish made with meat or fish, rice, potatoes and spices.

			Hugely popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladeshi biryani is often considered the best in the world.

			In the Bengali region, popular meats include mutton, goat, chicken and beef, but there is such a wide variety of biryani dishes available that you can try.

			A true traditional biryani involves different types of cooking and preparation, as marinated meat is layered with rice, potatoes and spices, the dish is jam packed with flavour.

			You will often find biryani served at special occasions or celebrations such as weddings, but it is also eaten as a regular meal throughout the weak, such is its popularity.

			Changri malai curry
		</div>
		<p>
			Changri malai curry is the most famous Bangladesh curry dish based on coconut milk, and is revered throughout the region, including India.

			Chingri Malai (or Chingri Macher Malaikari as it is sometimes known), is a delicious creamy, satisfying seafood curry that is prepared by cooking prawns or shrimp in a coconut milk sauce with aromatic spices and served with basmati rice. Coconut milk is a very common ingredient in Bangladeshi cuisine, and this Changri Malai curry is a perfect example of that.

			The word Malai suggests the dish was actually brought to the region by Malaysian sailors docking at the Bay of Bengal many years ago, and the use of coconut in curries gives credence to this theory since it is popular in South-East Asian cuisine.

			Bangladeshi cooking is famed for its use of seafood and fish in curries, so Chingri malai is definitely a dish to try if youâ€™re ever in the region.
